# Cartoonifier
 This is a python application that transforms an image into its cartoon using OpenCV. 
 To convert given image to a cartoon, multiple transformations are done. 
 Firstly, the image is converted to a Grayscale image. 
 Then, the Grayscale image is smoothened, and we try to extract the edges in the image. 
 Finally, we form a color image and mask it with edges. 
 This creates a beautiful cartoon image with edges and lightened color of the original image.
